# JOTA / JOTI Weekend 2019
#### 19th & 20th October 2019, Cranham Scout Centre

Jamboree on the Air – Jamboree on the Internet (JOTA-JOTI) is a fun and exciting annual experience for all young people in Scouting using the widest range of technology communication channels to educate, promote cultural awareness, develop tolerance, as well as enhance sharing, collaboration and teamwork, along with building a sense of belonging to the worldwide Scout Movement. It is a “travel-free” Jamboree that takes place wherever you are in the world. Connections between Scouts are made over amateur-radio links and internet.

Over the course of the weekend we'll teach participants how to use the online chat system Scout Link, participate in the Digital Campfire, use Amateur radio to speak to Scouts and Guides around Europe, and learn about the technologies behind it. 

Scouts taking part in the course and completing their workbook will be awarded the Communicator badge and the JOTA/JOTI badge as well.
